This project conducted sentiment analysis on a dataset – U.S airline tweets retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tango911/airline-sentiment-tweets). A comparison between Lexicon-based approach, particularly TextBlob and Vader, with machine learning-based classifiers like Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.
* **Python libraries used:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Wordcloud, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Textblob, Vader
* **Input:** Tweets
* **Output:** Sentiment of Tweets

This project aims to compare different unsupervised outlier detection algorithms using a dataset to identify anomalies in carbon dioxide flux. Candidate models considered include k-Nearest Neighbor Global (k-NN Global), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Density-based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN), Isolation Forest (IF), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM).

The best model in terms of area under the curve receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) hence will integrate into the client’s system for detection of future anomalous carbon dioxide flux. Flux data are measured and collected using the Eddy Covariance (EC) approach that has been set up at the Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies (CEMACS), Penang, Malaysia.

This project focus on classification of the Spotify tracks into their respective music genre by looking at the spotify features such as valence, danceability, energy, acousticness, speechiness and others. Algorithms used for modeling include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Neural Network (multi-layer Perceptron). Dataset used are retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db).
* **Python libraries used:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Input:** Spotify Tracks
* **Output:** Music Genre
